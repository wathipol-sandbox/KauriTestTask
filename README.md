# Kauri Test Task: Crypto Currency Explorer API
(My implementation of the service described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kUlZ7suZZPPEefWpu9WrdSJgBbVEutLtlXnRUehq4n8/edit?usp=sharing) (test task for Kauri))

> 8. The application should not rely on REST API or make real-time requests at the time of the API service call.

**Target:** Create a system that easily and quickly integrates with new exchanges without need to changing the flow of the application every time when we need add new exchanger as a data source.


* The project code base looks pretty big for test task, so I would be very grateful for constructive **feedback** from another developer if someone decides to look at my code

## Service design and structure

### Features:

- **Modular** design: Easy to add support for new exchanges.
- **Well-defined specifications:** System does not hardcode logic for data scraping. Instead of that app has defines a specification for implementing specific operators to retrieve data from the desired source.
- **Pluggable backends:** Support for different storage solutions.
- **Asyncio safe:** Safe to use in asynchronous applications.


### How to add new data sources?

1. Implement new child class of scraping operator with data scraping logic based on the specification for scraping operators (see. `./currencyexplorer/core`).
2. Import new scraper class to `./app/scrapers/__init__.py` file.
3. The system automatically registers the new operator and data from this source can be requested by API methods ! 


## Usage Guide


## Demo:

App is ready to launch on Google Cloud Run, but at the moment app deployed on simple VM using Dokku (additional configuration is required for using Binance API in GCR, because some IP ranges is prohibited by Binance policy). 

API endpoint's aviable from here:
```

```

[Swagger Docs](https://kauri-test.wathipol.sa.com/docs)
[Redoc Docs](https://kauri-test.wathipol.sa.com/redoc)

> DEMO Prod for preview only. Images has not been tested and is not a real production flow


### API usage:

After successful launch of the application, interactive documentation will be available along the path: ```{host}/docs``` or ```{host}/redoc```

> The Swager documentation in the header also contains a description of how to work with the WebSocket interface for receiving API data.

### Local Build and Run:

1. Ð¡lone this repository and go to it
2. Touch `.env` file and put inside basic config vars:
    ```sh
    ENVIRONMENT="DEV"
    PORT=<APP CONTAINER PORT FOR EXPOSE>
    API_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN="<API BASIC AUTH TOKEN>"
    ```
3. Execute: (docker+docker-compose should be installed in your system)
    ```sh
    sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build
    ```
4. Now API and workers should launch successfully and be immediately accessible on the specified port in your local `.env` file

## Installing dependencies outside of docker container:

> Poetry must be installed in your python libary. Recommended version: poetry==1.4.2

**Install:**

```sh
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry install
```

### Deploy:

#### Deploy to Google Cloud Run & GAR
For this you can use a template SH script in the project folder - `push_and_deploy_gcloud.sh`

> Google Cloud Run **Not** the best solution to run ASGI application with background workers
> It can be launched without changing the script file, but for this you must specified env variables with project number and GAR region.


#### Deploy to Dokku VM
For this you can use a simple push to `dokku-release` branch of GitHub repository and  build with deployment will be automatically triggered


#### Push container to Google Cloud Container Registry from GitHub Actions
For this you can use a simple push to `gcloud-sync` branch of GitHub repository and build will be automatically triggered and then container image will be pushed to GCloud Container Registry

> Recommended to use Google Artifact Registry service instead of Google Cloud Container Registry because ontainer Registry will be unsupported soon.
